        "Conditional independence does not imply marginal independence or vice versa.  E.g. in the mortality rate example, $T$, $H$, and $Y$ are indicators for living in the US (vs in China), being 65+ years old (vs < 65), and for dying in the year 2019 (vs being alive at the end of the year) respectively.  It may happen that $P(Y = 1 | T = 0, H) = P(Y = 1 | T = 1, H)$, i.e. the mortality rate in the US and China is the same within each age group so that $Y$ and $T$ are *conditionally independent* given $H$.  However, if the proportion of elderly citizens is different in the two countries, $Y$ and $T$ may not be *marginally independent*.  This is apparent from the *law of total probability*:\n",
